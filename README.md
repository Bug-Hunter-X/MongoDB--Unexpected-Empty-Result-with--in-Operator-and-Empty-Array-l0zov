# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator and empty arrays.  The query `db.collection.find({field: {$in: []}})` unexpectedly returns no results, even if documents exist where the 'field' is defined.  This can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior in applications.

The solution involves handling the empty array case to ensure correct behavior based on the desired outcome.  Consider alternative approaches if you need to include all documents when dealing with a potentially empty array.  This solution provides illustrative examples to address such scenarios.
